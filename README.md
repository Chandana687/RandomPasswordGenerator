# RandomPasswordGenerator

A random password generator is a tool that creates unique and complex passwords by combining characters, numbers, and symbols randomly. It's used to enhance online security by making passwords difficult to guess or crack, especially against dictionary attacks. These generators are often found within password managers or as standalone online tools.
